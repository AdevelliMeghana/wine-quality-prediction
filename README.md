# üç∑ Red Wine Quality Classification

This project explores the *Red Wine Quality dataset* from Kaggle, aiming to predict whether a red wine is of good quality or not using a variety of classification models.

Each wine in the dataset is rated on a quality scale from 0 to 10. For simplicity, this task redefines the target variable into a *binary classification problem*:

- *Good Quality*: Rating ‚â• 7  
- *Not Good Quality*: Rating < 7  

## üß™ Features

The model uses 11 physicochemical properties of the wine as input features:

- Fixed Acidity  
- Volatile Acidity  
- Citric Acid  
- Residual Sugar  
- Chlorides  
- Free Sulfur Dioxide  
- Total Sulfur Dioxide  
- Density  
- pH  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  

These features are used to train and evaluate several machine learning classifiers.

## üéØ Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

- ‚úÖ To experiment with multiple classification algorithms and compare their performance  
- ‚úÖ To identify the most significant features that influence wine quality  
- ‚úÖ To create an end-to-end data science pipeline from preprocessing to model selection  

## üõ† Workflow

Here‚Äôs an overview of the steps followed in this project:

1. *Import Libraries* ‚Äì Setting up the environment  
2. *Load the Dataset* ‚Äì Reading in the CSV file  
3. *Data Exploration* ‚Äì Getting a feel for distributions, correlations, and summary statistics  
4. *Missing Values Check* ‚Äì Ensuring data quality  
5. *Feature Engineering* ‚Äì Creating the binary target and scaling inputs  
6. *Class Imbalance Analysis* ‚Äì Understanding the distribution of good vs. bad wines  
7. *Model Preparation* ‚Äì Splitting data into training and testing sets  
8. *Model Training & Evaluation* ‚Äì Applying various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
9. *Model Selection* ‚Äì Choosing the best performing model based on accuracy and other metrics  

## üìä Results & Insights

- *Top Features*: Alcohol, Sulphates, and Volatile Acidity emerged as key predictors of wine quality.  

## ü•Ç Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into wine quality prediction using machine learning. With a well-tuned model and proper feature analysis, it's possible to distinguish good wines from average ones using chemical characteristics alone.
